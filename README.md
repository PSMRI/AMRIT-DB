## Introduction  

The AMRIT-DB service leverages Flyway within a Spring Boot framework to manage and clone empty database schema tables. It ensures that database structures remain consistent with application requirements, reducing setup time and preventing discrepancies.  

---

## Key Features  

- **Schema Management**: Automates database schema creation and version control using Flyway.  
- **Migration Scripts**: Supports SQL-based migration scripts for defining tables, constraints, and relationships.  

### Mandatory Database  

Ensure the following databases are created:  

- `db_iemr`  
- `db_reporting`  
- `db_identity`  
- `db_1097_identity`  

---

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed before starting:  

- Java 17  
- Maven 3.6+  
- MySQL 8  

---

## Creating Migrations  

Flyway migrations are stored in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory. Each schema has its own subfolder.  

- Place new or updated migration scripts in the corresponding schema folder.  
- Follow Flywayâ€™s naming convention:  
  - Example: `V1__InitialSetup.sql`, `V2__AddNewColumn.sql`  

For subsequent changes, increment the version number, e.g., `V3__<description>.sql`.  

---

## Build Configuration  

1. **Setup Local Properties**:  
   - Copy `common_example.properties` to `common_local.properties` and update it for your environment.  
   - File location: `src/main/environment`  

2. **Create Build Configuration in STS/Eclipse**:  
   - Go to **Run > Run Configurations**.  
   - Select **Maven Build** and create a new configuration.  
   - Set the **Base Directory** to the `AMRIT-DB` module.  
   - Set **Goals** to:  
     ```
     clean install -DENV_VAR=local
     ```  
   - Go to **Environment** tab and click **Add**.  Set
     ```
     Name : ENV_VAR 
     Value: local
     ```
   - Apply and run the configuration.  

---

## Run Configuration  

1. **Setup Spring Boot Configuration**:  
   - Go to **Run > Run Configurations**.  
   - Select **Spring Boot App (STS)** or **Java Application (Eclipse)** and create a new configuration.  
   - Choose the project and main class.  
   - Apply and run the configuration.  

2. **Verify Application**:  
   - Access Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)  

---

## Running Migrations  

1. **Database Credentials**:  
   - Add credentials in `common_local.properties`.  

2. **Run Migrations**:  
   - Flyway automatically runs migrations at application startup if configured correctly.  
   - Start the application using:  
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run -DENV_VAR=local
     ```  

---

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting  

- **Migration Failures**:  
  - Check SQL syntax and review the `flyway_schema_history` table for errors.  

- **Database Connection Issues**:  
  - Verify details in `application.properties`.
